# Notes
- The **brute force** method was a simple example of nesting *for loops* and applying *if statements*
- The **optimal method however made use of *maps*, more specifically *unordered maps*. Something we didn't learn so much at uni.
-- Maps by comparison to vectors are *containers that have key values* that can be referenced to
